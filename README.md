# Project 2: Moodiful

Moodiful is a website app that helps users track their moods and self-care routine on a daily basis. Moodiful provides access to historical moods, and lets users sort by and examine the impact of their self-care routines.

This app was built using Express.js, Handlebars.js, Sequelize, MySQL, Passport, Chart.js, jQuery UI, and more.

## Using Moodiful

The user begins by either registering a new account or by logging in. The user is able to log their current mood using slider values, and is then provided follow-up questions to confirm their recent self-care activities. The user is redirected to a line chart showing their historical moods and is able to then sort the data by order of entries or by days they completed particular self-care tasks.

### Future Development

* Display monthly and yearly mood charts.
* Track more self-care activities and allow sorting by multiple activities.
* Provide suggestions based on the userâ€™s mood input/self-care correlations.
* Allow authorized access to second party for use as coaching tool.
* Analyze trends and give feedback.
